# Numpy-Basics
NumPy basic tutorial
    If not already install numpy
        $ pip install numpy

    + AccessChange
        - We go over, Specific elements row and column, Specific row, Gets start and end index, Change numbers, create a 3D array, Ger specific element in 3D array, Replace an element within the 3D array

    + Array
        - We go over, making a 1D and 2D arrays, Get dimension, get shape, get type, get size, and total size

    + Initializing
        - We go over, how to make a 0/1/custom matrix, using Full_like matrix, Random decimal number matrix, random int matrix, identify matrix shape, repeating array

    + Mathematics
        - We go over, Adding/Subtracting/dividing/multiplying, Adding arrays together, an array to the power of, sin and cos, combining different shapes (arrays of different sizes), find the determinant

    + Reorganzing
        - We go over, vertically and horiztonal stacking, and arranging the array in so many values

    + Statistics
        - We go over, finding the minimum and maximum number, and find the sum 
        - Add axis=1 to find in min/max in differnent rows
        - Adding axis will add values going downwards

    + Variables
        - We go over, how to copy arrays
